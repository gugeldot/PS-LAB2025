Patterns package
================

This page documents the `patterns` package which contains small reusable
design-pattern utilities used across the project (Command, Observer,
Mediator, Memento, Prototype, Decorator, Singleton, Iterator).

   environment lacks graphical dependencies (e.g. ``pygame``), use the
   mocking approach in ``conf.py`` described in the project docs.
